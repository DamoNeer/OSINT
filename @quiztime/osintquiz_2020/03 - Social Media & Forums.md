# Challenge

In September 2019 someone posted in an aviation forum a quote that explained how Christiaan Triebert has used shadows, that were cast by towers around a launch pad, as sun dials. What is the username of the account that posted this? When you found the name, make sure it's all in lower case, calculate the MD5 hash and send it in.
