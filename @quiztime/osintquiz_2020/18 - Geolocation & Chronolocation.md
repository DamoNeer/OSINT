# Challenge

Time for some 'chronolocation', or determining the exact time a scene has taken place. Look at the following image by Julia Bayer and perform the following steps:

1: Determine the location Julia Bayer was standing
2: Be sure about the location! Find out where she stood, not just the name of the establishment she visited
3: Find out the direction of the sun at that particular moment
4: Read the 'Azimuth' and round it up or down, up to 2 degrees accuracy, making it an even number

Send the degrees that you have as an answer, after you round it up or down, and calculated the MD5 hash!

# Solution

On Google map, I looked for Holzmarkt and a place that is close to the river so that I can get a closer look on Street view.

I came across this spot which does contain the two chimneys in the original photo.

Next, I used SunCalc to determine what the 'Azimuth' is.

I placed the center of the circle exactly where I think the person was standing at that time. Then, I adjusted the time until the sun appears to be where the chimneys are just like in the photo.
