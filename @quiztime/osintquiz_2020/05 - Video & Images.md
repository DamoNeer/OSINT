# Challenge

For this question I'm going to feature the awesome Dutch OSINT Guy Nico. And we'll be looking at YouTube videos, and some online tools that are designed for them. Using a tool that can investigate YouTube content, can you tell me what the exact timestamp of the following video is?

Link to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUVFeXSdkO8

Extract the exact date and time from the timestamp of the video, and convert it as follows:

yyyymmddhhmmss

Then calculate the MD5 hash and send it in.
