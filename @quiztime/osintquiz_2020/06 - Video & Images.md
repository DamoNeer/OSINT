# Challenge

Time to have a crack at the following image:

![graffiti](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81070073/121271588-de87bb00-c878-11eb-95d3-7eef29556f88.jpg)

Provide the name of the person who initially uploaded it to a 'wiki' platform. I want the full name, so the first and last name, all in lowercase and no spaces. Then calculate the MD5 hash and send in your answer.

# Solution

Yandex led me to an Instagram post of a slightly larger version of the image.

I put that image on different reverse image search engines and Bing gave me multiple options and I checked the ones that contain "wiki" in it.

[Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Graffiti_art,_Epplehaus_T%C3%BCbingen_(2018).jpg) is the correct link that will lead us to the uploader's full name.
