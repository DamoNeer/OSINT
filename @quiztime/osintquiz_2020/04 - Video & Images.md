# Challenge

A little Dutch touch in this question. There's a weird artwork in Indianapolis that has its own Wikipedia entry here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funky_Bones

The photo on the Wikipedia page can be found all over the internet, but one of the oldest uploads out there is a stock photo site. Are you able to find this stock photo? Then grab the original filename and calculate the MD5 hash. No need to convert anything to lower case, just calculate the MD5 hash of this exact filename that you found on the stock photo website.

# Solution

Tool: Yandex
