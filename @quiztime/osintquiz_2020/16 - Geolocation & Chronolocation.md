# Challenge

This statue can be found somewhere in the world, and even has his own 'square'. Are you able to find out where this statue is, and find the name of the 'square' it can be found?

# Solution

Putting the image on Yandex along with the German word "square", I was able to find a similar picture. (The statue is staring at the same slopes)

Performing a reverse image search on that image instead, I got the address: Johannes-Rau-Platz, 40213 DÃ¼sseldorf Germany statue and I put that on Goolge maps to find the name of its square.
