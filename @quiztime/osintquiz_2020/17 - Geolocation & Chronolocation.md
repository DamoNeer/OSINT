# Challenge

We're off to find another square! This time you can have a look at a beautiful photo on Instagram by Tilman Wagner. The city is given, but... What's the postal code of the square where you can find this statue?

# Solution

The location of the Instagram post is given to be "Oslo, Norway".

Putting that image on Yandex search along with the search term "oslo norway" gives this similar image.

There are coordinates of the statues on wikimedia and the coordinates will lead me to the postal code, which can later be found on Google Maps.
