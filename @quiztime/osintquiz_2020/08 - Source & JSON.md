When this scan was made, the webserver sent out slightly different headers than it does nowadays. Please provide the exact text that was sent in the "X-Hacker" header.

# Solution

Click on "HTTP" > "Expand All" > "Show Headers" > Look for the value for X-hacker.

Note: You can also find the value from right clicking on the given page and searching for the "X-hacker" tag. However, it will be different because "'" will be displayed as something different. 

Flag: If you're reading this, you should visit automattic.com/jobs and apply to join the fun, mention this header.
