I began my search by focusing on the building logo behind the statue and it seems to spell E-V-E-R-Y-M-A-N.

I did a google search and I realized it was a cinema brand in the UK. There are like less than 20 of them, so I could have clicked through each one on Google map and compare surroundings with the given photo.

However, with the google search "everyman cinema building", I was able to find this image which was the pivot point of the whole challenge for me.

The statue is on the far right corner! Also, this image told me it was the Everyman Cinema in Glasgow.

With the google search "Everyman Glasgow + sculpture", I found the statue's name.

I put its name on Google maps and I was able to find its exact location.

1. This man is located in Princess Square, 48 Buchanan St, Glasgow G13JN, UK
2. The building that he is looking at locates in between Royal Exchange Ct and S Exchange Ct. It doesn't appear to have a name...
3. Inside the building behind him, there are restaurants, shops, and a cinema.
