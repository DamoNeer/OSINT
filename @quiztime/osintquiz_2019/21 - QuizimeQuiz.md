# Challenge

Tilman Wagner (twone2) is one of the Quiztime crew on Twitter. One day he went for a walk and took a photo of a light bulb on a beach somewhere. At the exact same day this photo was posted another Quiztime crew member created a German post on social media, about how sad he was that he didn't stay another 3 or 4 nights in a certain city.
