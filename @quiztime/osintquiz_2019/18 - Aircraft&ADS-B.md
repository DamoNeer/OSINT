# Challenge

In November 2019 it was known that at least 8 flights were recorded by a helicopter with the ICAO address '4984B0'. Can you tell in which country this aircraft is stationed?

# Solution

I googled "helicopter ICAO 4984B0" and I came across this site: https://www.live-military-mode-s.eu/PublicArea/indexmilads5.php

I selected 4984B0 Enstrom and that gave me the answer.
