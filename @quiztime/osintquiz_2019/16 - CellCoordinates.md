# Challenge

What city are we in when our phone connects to an LTE-node with the following details:
- Cell ID: 134327553 (hex: 801ad01)
- eNB ID: 524717 (hex: 801ad)
- MCC: 505
- MNC: 1
- Region/LAC: 8240
  
# Solution

Tool: http://www.cell2gps.com/

I input the given parameters onto that website and I found the place. (Not sure why TD-LTE/FDD-LTE network won't give me the location despite the fact that the question said the phone connected to an LTE-node)
