# readyfortakeoff - challenge

Please find the TIME OF ARRIVAL AT DESTINATION of that first flight, so that we can place officers to arrest them.

Once again we have very little to go on, aside from what I think is a camera feed.

LIVE CAMERA FEED: http://87.54.59.228

# readyfortakeoff - solution

This challenge was weird and possibly it's because I am doing this challenge a year later.

The camera feed shows me that the departing airport is going to be Bornholm Airport in Denmark. 

I looked up its daily flight schedule and I noticed that the first flight tends to be DX31 which departs at 6:20am and arrives at Copenhagen at 7:00am. I have also made sure to look at the same day of the week which is a Wednesday according to the camera feed.

However, 7:00am is not the answer. 7:20am is the correct answer after a few tries using 7:00am as a baseline.

Answer: 07:20

# rollingeyes - challenge

So we can be confident we've actually spotted them, can you confirm the COLOUR of their HOODIE and the COLOUR of their T-SHIRT.

All they've given me is an overlay from the drone... Hopefully this is enough? I've attached it to this tasking for you. We think they were getting out of a car at the time.

Enter the flag as such: (HOODIE COLOUR) (SPACE) (T-SHIRT COLOUR)
