# suntan - challenge

People love telling the world about their holiday, but is this really a great idea?

What CITY is Sarah going on holiday to at the end of February?

# suntan - solution

Through James' followers, I was able to find two people whose name start with "Sarah".

Going through each profile, I deduced that the person we are concerned with here is Sarah Luxton (@sarah_luxton).

![](https://i.imgur.com/IhZf2bB.png)

Her most recent tweet contains a picture of a place she will be going to in two weeks, which matches the challenge description.

Performing a reverse google image search, I found the place to locate in Perth.

Answer: perth

# wagthetail - challenge

The team has been trying to work out where Person of Interest, Sarah, walks her dog. This is part of building up a profile of her movements.

We've obtained what we believe to be an office CCTV camera feed.

We have reason to suspect that it is overlooking one of the work desks belonging to one of our targets.

Can you confirm the COLOUR of the DESK SURFACE and the COLOUR of the DESK LEGS, just so we can be sure of what we're seeing and task the reconnaissance team further.

Enter the flag as:

We're trying to plan when is best to break into James' house to plant a bug.

What time does he start work? (UK time).

Answer: 2pm

# meme - challenge

We've been watching a bloke called George recently, you might have already done some work on him.

He's not that smart by the looks of things, could be a good person to look for a social media presence on.

In particular, we're after an access key for a program his company uses so that the team can ex-filtrate information to aid with our ongoing fraud investigations.

# partytime - challenge

Our intelligence analysts have reported that a whole bunch of our targets are having a party together on a Saturday night soon.

We want to deploy agents to see whats going on, but we can't risk blowing our cover turning up in a car. The road is pretty quiet and the property has very clear view of its surroundings, our reports suggest.

Find the location of the party and the best BUS ROUTE NUMBER to reach the party from Principality Stadium, Cardiff - where the surveillance team will be deployed from.

This sounds silly but we need to blend in with the public. The stakes are high.

Enter the BUS ROUTE NUMBER you think is best for this situation.

# partytime - solution

So far, we have a lot of person of interests: Pearce, James, George and Sarah.

Using twitter's advanced search, I used "party" as a keyword and I specified the twitter to be each of these accounts.

![](https://i.imgur.com/pDBWIRn.png)

I found this post which tells us where the party is at. Then, I used Google Map to find me the best bus route from Principality Stadium, Cardiff to 159 Llanedeyrn Rd, Cardiff. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/2McHQXS.png)

I chose the number 57 because it's the first bus that google recommends us to take in the route. 

If 57 didn't work, I would have entered 58.

Answer: 57
