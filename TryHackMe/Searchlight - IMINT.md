A friend of mine contacted me asking if I could help them locate a coffee shop that is supposed to serve the best lunch there is. 

They told me the coffee shop is somewhere in Scotland, and he sent me these two pictures.

# Solution

This one took a bit longer than the previous challenges.

I googled "The Edinburgh Woolen M" and google corrected it to be "The Edinburgh Woollen Mill" for me.

Putting both the name of the store and the word "scotland" on Google map, I see a couple of options.

Looking through each of the store photo carefully on Google Map, I found the one that matches.

# Solution

Typing "motorcycle deer staue" was sufficient in getting the name of the statue.

After reading the hint, I went to visitoslo.com and searched for outdoor sculptures.

It has an interative map that lets you see all of the sculptures there and it gives credit to all of the photographers: https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1A_CkmOlK8XEkE4W-0ramG-2T2fI&ll=59.912672493464456%2C10.737873734666774&z=14 

I tried searching for the name of photographer through Google reverse image search, but it did not work.

What is the name of this statue? sl{Rudolph the Chrome Nosed Reindeer}

Who took this image? sl{Kjersti Stensrud}
